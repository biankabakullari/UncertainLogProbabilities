Process mining is a research discipline that deals with the analysis of process related event data by discovering process models, checking conformance between real process runs and normative models, and improving the performance of processes in many aspects.
Most approaches assume that for each process instance a unique trace of performed activities can be extracted.
In uncertain event logs, however, many event attributes do not contain unique values, thus leading to many possible traces that might have been executed.
In this work, we exploit the information enclosing event data with explicit description of uncertainty, and obtain probability estimates for the realizations of uncertain process instances.
We motivate the importance of obtaining such estimates using conformance checking examples, and we also validate the obtained values on an example by means of the Monte Carlo simulation method.
Moreover, we introduce a new method for obtaining all possible orderings of events belonging to the same uncertain process instance, and analyze its performance against the baseline method both theoretically and experimentally.
